# Statistical-Analysis-of-Film-Data-Measures-of-Central-Tendency
 This  project aims to analyze the performance metrics of a collection of films through statistical analysis,  focusing on measures of central tendencies.  Understanding these variations is crucial for stakeholders, including producers,  distributors, and cinema owners, who rely on data-driven insights to make strategic decisions.
The primary objective of this report is to evaluate key numerical data points, such as Rank, Weekend Gross, Percentage Change on Last Week, Weeks 
on Release, Number of Cinemas, Site Average, and Total Gross to Date, using statistical measures like mean, median, mode, mid-range, range, variance, and standard deviation. These measures provide insights into the distribution, central positioning, and variability of the data, revealing 
trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. By analyzing these central tendencies, we can identify typical performance levels, detect anomalies, and understand the spread of the data, offering valuable benchmarks for future film releases. The findings are intended to guide strategic 
decisions in film marketing, distribution, and cinema management, ensuring that stakeholders can optimize their approaches based on empirical evidence. This report will present a detailed analysis of each measure, supported by visual aids like graphs, box plots and Q-Q plots to enhance comprehension. Through this statistical approach, the project seeks to provide a clear and concise evaluation of the data, highlighting the factors that influence film success in the marketplace.
